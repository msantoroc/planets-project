# Are we alone in the universe?

This is a basic study project in nodeJS that read a nasa CSV file with all probable habitable planets and filter to all that realy can be habitable.

### What do I learn with this?
- How read files and return data with nodeJS
- Which API I should use when I need to read a big data archive
- How choose a library that will be most useful to my project
